# 🎯 Step-by-Step Setup Guide

Follow these steps **IN ORDER**. I'll help you with each one!

## ⚠️ STEP 1: Start Docker Desktop (REQUIRED)

**You MUST do this first!**

1. **Open Docker Desktop** on your computer
   - Look for Docker Desktop in your Start menu
   - Or search for "Docker Desktop" in Windows search

2. **Wait for Docker to start**
   - You'll see a Docker icon in your system tray (bottom right)
   - Wait until it says "Docker Desktop is running"
   - This can take 1-2 minutes

3. **Verify Docker is running**
   - The Docker icon should be green/active
   - You can open Docker Desktop to see it's ready

**Once Docker Desktop is running, tell me and I'll continue with the next steps!**

## 📋 What We'll Do Next (After Docker Starts)

Once Docker is running, I'll help you with:

1. ✅ Start PostgreSQL database
2. ✅ Set up database tables with Prisma
3. ✅ Start backend server
4. ✅ Start frontend server
5. ✅ Test everything

## 🔄 Alternative: If You Don't Want to Use Docker

If you have PostgreSQL installed locally, you can use that instead:

1. Make sure PostgreSQL is running
2. Create a database named `inventory`
3. Update `.env` file with your local PostgreSQL connection string

But Docker is easier! Just start Docker Desktop and we'll continue.
